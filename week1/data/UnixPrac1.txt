#1 count lines of all fasta files within the directory
wc -l *.fasta

#2 Show output starting from the second line (+2) of the E.coli sequence
tail -n +2 E.coli.fasta 

#3 Show output starting from the second line of the E.coli sequence, delete (-d) newlines (\n) and count the number of characters 
tail -n +2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d "\n"| wc -m

#4 Show output starting from the second line of the E.coli sequence. Use "tr" function to delete ("-d") new lines ("\n"). Use "grep" function to find the string "ATGC" within the E.coli genome sequence, and use option "-o" to only print the matching string ("ATGC"). Count the number of words with "WC" function.

# 5:
# Define "AT" as a variable, which is defined as all of the As and Ts ("A\|T") within the E.coli genome after the second line (tail -n +2). wc -w command counts all A and T values to give a numerical answer.
# Define "GC" as a variable , which is defined as all of the Gs and Cs ("G\|C") within the E.coli genome after the second line (tail -n +2). wc -w command counts all A and T values to give a numerical answer.
# $ defines object as a variable
# ; Allows multiple commands to be run in a set order
# && allows multiple commands to be run in a set order, whereby the proceeding command will only run only if the previous command sucessfully runs (i.e. command 2 will only run if command 1 works)
# echo $AT/$GC - prints variable "AT" divided by variable "GC"
# scale value to 4 decmil places
# bc: bash calculator allows for basic calcuations in bash, -l: define the standard math library
