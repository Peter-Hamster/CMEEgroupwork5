# FILE OUTPUT
#############################
# Save the elements of a list to a file

#creates a variale (list to save) which is a list of numbers from 0-99
list_to_save = range(100) 

#defines the "testout" file as f and allows to be written in (w) 
#f is variable- set as the testout file in the sandbox dir which can be modified
f = open('../sandbox/testout.txt','w')

#string (I) redfine intergers as string in the "list to save" file. i is inividiual numbers in the list . f.write part newly defined list into "f"
for i in list_to_save:
    f.write(str(i) + '\n') ## Add a new line at the end

f.close()

- all this turns a list of numbers (1,2,3,etc) into a verticle list (text file called "testout") whereby the number values are defined as string

index  number
0        0
1        1
