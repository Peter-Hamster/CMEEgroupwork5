    Brief description: Biological computing and data visualisation in R 

    Languages: R


    Project structure and Usage: 
    1. Biological computing in R practicals
    - TreeHeight.R: calculates heights of trees given distance of each tree and exports results as a .pdf
    - Vectorize2.R: Modified script. Runs the stochastic Ricker equation with gaussian fluctuations. 
    - Florida.R: Permutation analysis of Florida temperatures and year 
    - Florida.tex: Latex file which creates a .pdf interpreting results of Florida.R
    2. Data visualisation Practicals
    - DataWrangTidy.R: Improved DataWrang.R script using tidyverse
    - PP_Dists.R : Script which creates three .pdf files, each plotting the disturbution of body mass and size ratio of predator and prey belonging to 5 different feeding groups, as well as a .csv file containing the mean and median of body mass and size ratio of predator and prey of 5 different feeding groups. Data is taken from the Ecological Archives of the ESA (Barnes et al. 2008, Ecology 89:881).
    - PP_Regress.R: Makes a linear model which measures the rerlationship between prey mass and predator mass based on feeding types and lifestage. Produces a .csv file with results of linear regression analysis and a .pdf file containing a graph made in ggplot, based off the one provided in the Data Visualisation notes
    - GPDD_Data.R: Script which produces a world map with sampling points based on GPDD data
    3. Data Visualisation notes:
    - Girko.K: Self sufficient script which runs Girko's Law simulation. This simulation calculates ellipse and plots on a graph.
    - MyBars.R: Self sufficient script which runs a function that creates a bar chart.
    - plotLin.R: Self sufficient script which annotates a linear regression plot.
    4. R notes:
    - control_flow.R: control flows
    - basic_io.R: basic io
    - boilerplate.R: boilerplate
    - R_conditionals.R : R conditionals
    - Vectorize1.R : Vectorization example
    - preallocate.R: Pre-allocates a vector 
    - apply1.R: using apply functions
    - apply2.R: using apply functions
    - sample.R: An example of vectorization involving lapply and sapply
    - browse.R: Debugging with browser function
    - try.R: illustrates try
