Project name / title: Week 3 CMEE Coursework

    Brief description: Biological computing and data visualisation in R 

    Languages: R


    Project structure and Usage: 
    1. Biological computing in R practicals
    - TreeHeight.R
    - Vectorize2.R 
    - Florida.R
    2. Data visualisation Practicals
    - DataWrangTidy.R: Improved DataWrang.R script using tidyverse
    - PP_Dists.R : Script which creates three .pdf files, each plotting the disturbution of body mass and size ratio of predator and prey belonging to 5 different feeding groups, as well as a .csv file containing the mean and median of body mass and size ratio of predator and prey of 5 different feeding groups. Data is taken from the Ecological Archives of the ESA (Barnes et al. 2008, Ecology 89:881).
    - PP_Regress.R:
    - GPDD_Data.R: Script which produces a world map with sampling points based on GPDD data
    3. Data Visualisation notes:
    - Girko.K: Self sufficient script which runs Girko's Law simulation. This simulation calculates ellipse and plots on a graph.
    - MyBars.R: Self sufficient script which runs a function that creates a bar chart.
    - plotLin.R: Self sufficient script which annotates a linear regression plot.
