    Project structure and Usage: 
    1. Practicals 
    - LV1.py: Runs a function which returns the growth rate of consumer and resource population and produces two graphs which visualise the consumer-resource population dynamics
    - oaks_debugme.py: Reads a .csv file containing species information, and categorigies the data entries which starts with the string "quercus" as an oak. This script produces a .csv file which prints all these oak values.
    2. In class scripts
    - profileme.py: This script is used to demonstrate profiling
    - profileme2.py: This script is used to demonstrate profiling
    - TestR.py: This script is used to test how to run R in python. Prints "Hello, this is R!"
    - TestR.py: This script is used to test how to run R in python. Uses subprocesses. 
    - timeitme.py: Tests the speed of running a loops vs a vectorised function
