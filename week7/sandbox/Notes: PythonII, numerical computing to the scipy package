Notes:
lists are to arrays as dataframes are to matrices, ie. lists and df can have different datatypes, (but may be less efficent to run computational analysis on)

numerical intergration: basically calculating area underneath  the curve of a graph

Comp traezoidal rule: uses (equal size?) trapezia to find approx value (i.e., divides area up into tripezia, calculates area of tripezia  and then add up)
note: dx is the size of the trapezia. A lower number will yield more accurate results, but will be slower
smallest dx is ideally based on scale of the graph (ie, here the units in the x axis go up in 1, so 1 is the lowest ideal value. but if units in the x went up in 0.5 (i.e, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) then dx=0.5 would be more the lowest ideal value (before you get diminishing returns)
